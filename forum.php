		<p class="text-white">Here we are, the final level! If any of you are Hexen fans, you'll quickly realize I used some of Korax's voice-lines. I had done it mainly because I kept imagining the "Greetings, mortal." line in my head whenever I teleported into the boss room. Also, I was originally going to try and go for a more creepy, atmospheric/ambient kind of tone. However, after playing the level a few times for inspiration, I really wanted to add some riffs and more energy to it! Anyways, I hope you all enjoy the cover! ~DAR</p>

		<h1 class="text-danger font-weight-bold">(INSANE MOD) Perfected Doom 3 - All Guns Shown</h1>
		<p class="text-white">The Classic Doom 3 modification is a remake of the original Doom game, by id Software. The main emphesis is that of brining the older game up to date in a modern 						graphics engine. The project makes use of all of Doom 3's advanced
								graphical features while retaining the feel and gameplay of the original game.

								The project will only cover the shareware levels due to many reasons that include the following :

								- We are bored of converting over peoples stuff and want to create something of our own.
								- The mod started off as a fun way to learn how to mod for Doom 3, and we all feel we have learnt what we need to make our own project.
								- A more minor reason is the legalities of remaking anything past the freely availible shareware episode.

								Our latest build is version 1.3.1 which is the final version that we plan to release. This version is numbered 1.3.1 to reflect the fact that it has been tested to work with Doom 3 patch release 1.3.1, and thus works both with Doom 3 on steam and windows vista.

		<p class="text-white">John Carmack, co-creator of the iconic FPS Doom, might finally return to the IP thanks to Microsoft's recent purchase of ZeniMax Media. The massive $7.5 billion buyout gives the tech giant rights not only to Doom but also to major Bethesda franchises like The Elder Scrolls and Fallout. The deal already has tremendous implications for the gaming industry moving forward, even opening the possibility of a sequel to the beloved Fallout New Vegas once again helmed by Obsidian Entertainment.

		It also changes things for John Carmack, who has had a very complicated relationship with ZeniMax Media and id Software. In 1991, Carmack co-founded id Software alongside John Romero, and together they were responsible for some of the earliest and most iconic first-person shooters. In 2009, the company was purchased by ZeniMax Media, and in 2013 Carmack left to become CTO of Oculus and help the company design tech for its VR headsets. This led to a legal dispute between ZeniMax and Oculus in 2014; the former alleged that it owned the intellectual property rights to all contributions Carmack made to Oculus while he was working for id. The dispute was settled out of court in 2018.</p>
